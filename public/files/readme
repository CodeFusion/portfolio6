# Portfolio Software 7

## Welcome
This portfolio was made to emulate the feeling of a 90s Macintosh, somewhere between System 6 and System 7.

## Why System 7?
The design language and monochrome interface is uniquely retro and felt like a fun challenge to recreate. Plus, despite being more of a Linux and Windows user, I have fond memories of using iMacs and an old Macintosh Classic in elementary school.

## Features
- File explorer and desktop with draggable and highlightable icons
- Window manager with movable, resizable, and collapsable windows (double-click the titlebar)
- Markdown file viewer
- About page

## Notes
This is not meant to be a perfect recreation of System 7, so some designs and functionalities may differ.

Mobile support is limited - additional viewports will be added in the future.
